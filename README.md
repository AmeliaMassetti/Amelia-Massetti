HiðŸ¤™ðŸ‘‹, My name's Amelia

This is my personal repository

I'm a computor science student and this is my first time using GitHub. This ia my first time coding unless you count the coding we were forced to do in 4th and 5th grade.

I'm not sure why I'm taking computor science class, it just appeared in my schedule this year and I thought it would be fun.

My other interests are art and traveling. I plan to be an animation major in college and I travel at least 4 times a year with my family or on my own. 

My goal for this class is to get a basic understanding of coding and to have fun. I'm not experienced at all and I'd be happy if I just understood coding just a little bit better, so it doesn't just look like a bunch of letters and numbers.
